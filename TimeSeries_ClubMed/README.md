# 2. Files Functionalites ###

The table below lists the Jupyter file names along with a brief description of their functionality: 

| File Name	| Description 
|------------|----------|
|DSM_ClubMed_DC.ipynb | This file is dedicated to data cleaning, encompassing processes aimed at identifying, correcting, or removing inaccurate, incomplete, or irrelevant data from datasets to enhance data quality and ensure reliable analysis. |
| DSM_ClubMed_EDA.ipynb | This file showcases a broader scope Exploratory Data Analysis , complementing a more detailed EDA conducted using PowerBI. It provides a comprehensive overview of the data, while the PowerBI-based analysis delves deeper into specific aspects, leveraging its advanced visualization tools for a more detailed examination. |
| DSM_ClubMed_SL.ipynb | This file is dedicated to time series forecasting using statistical models, focusing on predicting future values based on historically observed data. It encompasses the application of various statistical techniques to model and analyze time-dependent patterns, aiming to provide accurate forecasts. |
| DSM_ClubMed_ML.ipynb |  This file specializes in time series forecasting through the application of machine learning models, aiming to predict future data points by learning from past trends and patterns. The focus is on developing predictive models that can accurately forecast future events, adapt to changing trends, and provide valuable insights for decision-making processes.|
| DM_ClubMed.pbix |  This file is dedicated to conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using PowerBI. It leverages PowerBI's powerful data visualization and analysis capabilities to thoroughly examine and understand the dataset's underlying patterns, relationships, and anomalies. Through interactive charts, graphs, and dashboards, this EDA aims to uncover insights, identify trends, and inform subsequent analysis or modeling decisions, making it an essential step in the data analytics process.|
